                <p>Welcome to Neurotopia - a representation of several of the experiences of neurodiverse students in the average secondary state school classroom. Before you begin your journey, I would like to invite you to consider several points to ensure your exploration of this project is as informed as possible.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Neurodiversity is nuanced. I do not claim that this project is a complete portrayal of all neurodivergent experiences - as the ways in which each neurological condition manifests is deeply dependent on the individual - their biology, beliefs and environment. </li>
                    <br><li>I do not claim that dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder are the only neurodivergent conditions. I have chosen to portray these specifically due to my aim to spread as much awareness as I could. Since these three conditions are the most common neurological conditions in the UK, they have been chosen. No more than three conditions have been chosen due to time constraints.</li>
                    <br><li>The experiences portrayed in this site have been selected from credible sources and can be traced back to the identification of individuals who have experienced these events.</li>
                    <br><li>Although the utopian classroom may seem like an ‘easy fix’ to solving the issue of access to education when neurodiverse, there is in fact no such classroom that can solve this problem, hence its description as ‘utopian’. To me, utopia is a journey, not a destination and although we can do as much as we can as a society to reach this destination, we will always be constrained by cost, scope or time.</li>
