        <p id="popup-rug">According to current evidence, expecting students to use traditional desks for extended periods of time without movement only leads to less attentiveness and increased misbehaviour [1], therefore it is crucial we provide flexible seating to support learning. These seating arrangements should be designed with neurodiversity in mind. Recommendations of potential arrangements include a mix of therapy balls [2], armchairs, standing desks and equipment for children to ‘fidget’ with during class. This in particular helps children who process sensory inputs differently to neurotypical students [3]. Placing a rug or carpet in the middle of the classroom and cloth under chair legs helps to reduce the noise travelling along the room, making it easier for students who may experience overstimulation more often [4].
